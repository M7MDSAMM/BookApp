# Laravel Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run your Laravel project, including database creation, migration, seeding, and serving the application.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   Composer
-   PHP (version required by your Laravel project)
-   A database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    First, clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/M7MDSAMM/BookApp.git
    cd path-to-your-project
    Install Dependencies
    ```

Install PHP dependencies through Composer:


composer install
Environment Configuration

Copy the example environment file and make the necessary configuration adjustments specific to your environment:


cp .env.example .env
Then, edit the .env file to configure your database settings:

makefile

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
Database Setup
Create Database

Create a new database for your project on your database server. The name of the database should match the DB_DATABASE value set in your .env file.

Run Migrations
Migrate your database to create the schema:

php artisan migrate

Run Seeders
Populate your database with initial data using seeders:


php artisan db:seed

Optionally, you can run migrations and seeders together with:
php artisan migrate --seed

Serving the Application
Finally, serve your Laravel application using the Artisan command:

php artisan serve
This command will start a development server at http://localhost:8000.

Access your application through the browser using the provided URL.

Additional Information
For more details on Laravel installation and environment setup, refer to the official Laravel documentation.
Ensure all PHP extensions required by Laravel are installed and enabled in your PHP configuration.
Congratulations! You are now ready to start developing your Laravel application.


This guide assumes a MySQL database for simplicity, but you should adjust the database configuration according to your project's requirements.
